# Travis CI Project: RAGNAROK Integration  

## Project Description  
This project demonstrates how to use **Travis CI** to automate the testing and execution of a binary file (`RAGNAROK`) alongside a Python script (`RAGNAROK.py`). The repository is designed for educational purposes, particularly for school projects or small-scale demonstrations of CI/CD pipelines. It highlights the importance of automation in ensuring consistent and reliable execution across different environments.  

## Files  
- **RAGNAROK**: A precompiled binary file that forms the core of this project.  
- **RAGNAROK.py**: A Python script that interacts with or complements the functionality of the binary.  
- **.travis.yml**: Travis CI configuration file that defines the build and test process.  

## Purpose  
This repository is primarily created for **school projects** or **educational demonstrations**. It showcases how CI/CD pipelines can be used to streamline workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and validate the compatibility and functionality of different components.  

## How the Travis CI Pipeline Works  

The Travis CI pipeline, configured via the `.travis.yml` file, is structured as follows:  

1. **Environment Setup**  
   - Install dependencies needed for running the Python script.  
   - Ensure the environment is prepared to execute the binary file.  

2. **Execution Stage**  
   - Run the `RAGNAROK` binary file and capture its output.  
   - Execute the `RAGNAROK.py` script to verify its functionality and ensure proper interaction with the binary.  

3. **Testing and Validation**  
   - Compare the outputs or logs generated by the binary and script against expected results.  
   - Verify that both components execute without errors.  

## Example `.travis.yml` Configuration  
Below is an example of the `.travis.yml` configuration used in this project:  

```yaml
language: python
python:
  - "3.9"  # Specify Python version

script:
  - chmod +x RAGNAROK  # Ensure the binary is executable
  - ./RAGNAROK  # Run the binary
  - python RAGNAROK.py  # Execute the Python script
